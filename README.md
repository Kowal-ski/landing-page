# landing-page

This project is a landing page for a website; it allows me to put all of the CSS skills I've recently learned to use, such as styling elements like images and buttons, as well as using flex to create a responsive layout structure for this website, all while building on top of the HTML and git/git-hub skills like staging, commit, pushing, and merging my code for this project.
