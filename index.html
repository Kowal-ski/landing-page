                <p>
                    Artists should be anonymous not because it doesn't 
                    matter who the artist is (with a few exceptions), 
                    but because it allows both the artist and the audience 
                    to be real. The anonymous artist is free to express 
                    themselves without regard for success or failure, and 
                    they cannot question their own motives. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    We must not confuse art with artists. We must focus our 
                    attention on the art itself and judge it according to 
                    our own aesthetic sensibilities, which we must constantly 
                    develop by seeking out art where it is hidden or 
                    overshadowed; choosing what to be exposed to rather than 
                    passively allowing ourselves to be exposed to whatever 
                    is front and centre. As many of us are aware, it is not 
                    where the best art is found. This is our way of thinking.
